== ls-frontend
JavaScript library independent (ideally) version of the LemonStand frontend. Only uses jQuery at the moment.

Warning! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson! This is an alpha version. That means it is subject to highly volatile changes. 

MooTools (language prototyping, classes), is a much different library than jQuery (functional, chaining, modular). Compromises have been made for backwards combatibility.

== Installation
1) Remove <?= include_resources() ?> from your templates.
2) Include jQuery first, then ls_cms.js into your template.
3) Include ls_cms.css if you want default styles.
4) Remove any references to jQuery.noConflict(). The $ (money) variable is required.

== Example (change the appropriate paths)
<link href="<?= root_url('/resources/css/ls_cms.css') ?>" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
<script src="<?= root_url('/resources/js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js') ?>"></script>
<script src="<?= root_url('/resources/js/ls_cms.js') ?>"></script>
